## Section 1: Core Statistical Concepts

### Core Implications of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
- **Central Limit Theorem - Explained Simply** by Brandon Foltz
- **Central Limit Theorem** by Khan Academy

### Core Implications of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
1. **Quality Control in Manufacturing**: Using the CLT to ensure the sample means of product dimensions are within acceptable limits.
2. **A/B Testing in Marketing**: Leveraging the CLT to infer the performance of different marketing strategies from sample data.
3. **Financial Risk Management**: Applying the CLT to model the distribution of portfolio returns and assess risk.
4. **Customer Satisfaction Surveys**: Using the CLT to estimate the average satisfaction score from survey samples.
5. **Operational Efficiency**: Assessing the average time for service delivery across multiple branches to ensure consistency.

### P-value and the Intuition Behind It
- **Understanding P-values - Statistics Help** by Dr Nic's Maths and Stats
- **What is a p-value? Why we need them and how they work** by StatQuest with Josh Starmer

### P-value and the Intuition Behind It
1. **A/B Testing for Website Optimization**: Determining if changes to a website significantly improve user engagement.
2. **Clinical Trials for New Drugs**: Assessing whether a new drug performs better than a placebo.
3. **Quality Assurance**: Testing if the defect rate in a production process is significantly different from a historical rate.
4. **Customer Behavior Analysis**: Evaluating whether a new feature in an app leads to increased usage.
5. **Market Research**: Testing if a new product variant significantly impacts consumer preference.

### Randomised Controlled Trials (RCT) and Core Assumptions
- **Randomized Controlled Trials** by CrashCourse
- **Understanding Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)** by iBiology

### Randomised Controlled Trials (RCT) and Core Assumptions
1. **Marketing Campaigns**: Measuring the effectiveness of different marketing messages by randomizing recipients.
2. **Employee Training Programs**: Evaluating the impact of training by randomly assigning employees to training and control groups.
3. **Product Development**: Testing the impact of new product features by randomly assigning beta testers.
4. **Health Interventions**: Assessing the effect of wellness programs on employee health by random assignment.
5. **Pricing Strategies**: Determining the impact of different pricing strategies by randomly assigning them to different regions.

### Intervals and the Intuition Behind Them
- **Confidence Intervals - Intro to Inferential Statistics** by Udacity
- **Prediction Intervals Explained - Statistics Help** by Dr Nic's Maths and Stats

### Intervals and the Intuition Behind Them
1. **Sales Forecasting**: Constructing confidence intervals around sales predictions to assess uncertainty.
2. **Budget Estimation**: Using prediction intervals to estimate future expenses and revenues.
3. **Customer Satisfaction**: Creating confidence intervals for average customer satisfaction scores to inform management decisions.
4. **Operational Planning**: Estimating the range of possible outcomes for project completion times.
5. **Inventory Management**: Predicting future inventory needs within a certain range to avoid stockouts or overstocking.

### Design of Experiments, Sample Size Estimation, Power
- **Design of Experiments (DOE) - Introduction** by ASQ
- **Determining Sample Size Needed for Study** by Matt Nokes
- **Understanding Statistical Power and Significance Testing** by StatQuest with Josh Starmer

### Design of Experiments, Sample Size Estimation, Power
1. **New Product Launch**: Designing experiments to test different versions of a product before launch.
2. **Service Improvement**: Estimating the sample size needed to detect a difference in customer service levels after changes are implemented.
3. **Market Research**: Ensuring sufficient sample size to detect differences in consumer preferences between regions.
4. **Process Optimization**: Experimenting with different manufacturing processes to determine the most efficient method.
5. **Advertising Effectiveness**: Determining the power needed to detect the impact of different advertising channels on sales.

### T-tests with Reasonable Depth
- **Student's t-test - explained simply** by Data School
- **T-Test (Independent Samples) - SPSS (part 1)** by Research by Design
- **Welch's T-Test** by The Statistics Mann

### T-tests with Reasonable Depth
1. **Sales Performance**: Comparing the average sales before and after a new sales strategy.
2. **Employee Productivity**: Testing if training programs significantly increase employee productivity.
3. **Customer Feedback**: Comparing customer satisfaction scores between two service methods.
4. **Market Segmentation**: Evaluating differences in average spending between customer segments.
5. **Product Testing**: Assessing whether two different versions of a product have significantly different performance outcomes.
